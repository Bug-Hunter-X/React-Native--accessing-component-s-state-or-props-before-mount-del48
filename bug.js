This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has been mounted.  This commonly happens within the component's constructor or before the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array has run.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProp')
  }
  render() {
    return <View></View>;
  }
}
```
